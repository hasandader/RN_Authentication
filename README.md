# RN_Authentication
This app is build to explain making authintication using friebase and APIs.
Because this app includes screens I needed to use navigation to navigate between screens. This is a link for navigation library I used https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/tree/v1 . I used v1 of this library react-native-navigation@1.1.x . If you face any problems with this library just visit their site and follow installation steps for ios or android, you can find them at docs, they are simple and easy.
## Usage
* ``` git clone https://github.com/hasandader/RN_Authentication.git ```
* ``` cd RN_Authentication/RN_Authentication ```
* ``` npm install ```
*  ``` react-native run-ios ``` or ``` react-native-android ```
